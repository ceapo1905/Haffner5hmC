The 5hmC Haffner Project
========================
## Description
This repository contains the data analysis of 5-hydroxi-methyl-Cytosine (5hmC) expression in genitorurinary tumors, including bladder (urothelial carcinoma), kidney (renal cell carcinoma), prostate (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia), and penis (squamous cell carcinoma). The aim of the project is to evaluate the immunohistochemical expression and prognostic usefulness of 5hmC in the aforementioned tumors.

### Bladder Cancer
This dataset is composed of 55 cases diagnosed as urothelial carcinoma of urinary bladder. The files associated with this analysis are the following:
